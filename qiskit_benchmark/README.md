For modular multiplication the code we used was based off of this file: https://github.com/tiagomsleao/ShorAlgQiskit/blob/master/Shor_Normal_QFT.py

Prior to running the code you'll need to install various packages from qiskit to import from (see import statements in the files).

To draw the circuit diagrams you'll need to install matplotlib and pylatexenc; both can be installed via pip.

This code was run using the PyCharm IDE using a venv environment; the packages were installed using PyCharm's package manager.
